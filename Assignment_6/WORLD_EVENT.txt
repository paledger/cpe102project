1) Click the mouse anywhere within the bounds of the world.
2) A hole will form only if the following conditions are met:
	> There are no other apocalyptic holes that will overlap the current hole
	> The hole created will remain within the bounds of the world (will not spawn off screen)
	
	A bunny will spawn at the top left corner of the hole. Any entities or obstacles currently at the hole will be sucked into it (deleted). Bunnies can traverse over holes.
3) When a bunny comes in contact with (adjacent to) a miner, the miner will become a carrot.
	Carrots are stationary.
4) Bunnies move randomly. They spawn from the holes and eat all entities except for:
	> Blacksmiths
	> Other bunnies
	> Obstacles
	> Miners
		> Bunnies will turn miners into carrots. If they come across a carrot, they'll eat the carrot.
