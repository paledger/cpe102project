ASSIGNMENT 3 
CPE 102
QUESTIONS/COMMENTS:
A >> need to write the functionality so that the interface Resource works
A >> figure out what type actions are and change in actionable class
P >> grid and ordered list are not defined in java (in world model)


A >> 
- Don't initialize pending_actions in the Actions class
- Make it possible for us to super(); the initialized arguments in Entity from the 4 bottom classes so that lower classes can access it


P >> I'm a little bit confused about where current_img in 
Entity is coming from....

P >> What do you think about the class I made for the global data in 
entities.java? I wasn't sure how else to do that, since Java doesn't
allow data outside of classes. 
  >> I asked Keen about this, and he said that we would define the variables in the respective classes, so that means, you would take them out of that Data class I have right now and put it into the classes you are making of Ore, OreBlob, etc. 

P >> for hasattr() method used in Actionable in entities.java, this website 
might be helpful (I haven't looked it over yet):
