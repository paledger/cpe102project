ASSIGNMENT 3 
CPE 102

QUESTIONS/COMMENTS:

P >> I'm a little bit confused about where current_img in 
Entity is coming from....

P >> What do you think about the class I made for the global data in 
entities.java? I wasn't sure how else to do that, since Java doesn't
allow data outside of classes. 
  >> I asked Keen about this, and he said that we would define the variables in the respective classes, so that means, you would take them out of that Data class I have right now and put it into the classes you are making of Ore, OreBlob, etc. 

P >> for hasattr() method used in Actionable in entities.java, this website 
might be helpful (I haven't looked it over yet):
