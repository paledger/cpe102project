ASSIGNMENT 3 
CPE 102

QUESTIONS/COMMENTS:

P >> What do you think about the class I made for the global data in 
entities.java? I wasn't sure how else to do that, since Java doesn't
allow data outside of classes.

P >> for hasattr() method used in Actionable in entities.java, this website 
might be helpful (I haven't looked it over yet):
